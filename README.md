Many individuals have sought browser-based automation.
I do not intend to use it for personal gain, as it generates minimal income in my country.
However, it may hold more value for individuals residing in countries with a high dollar-to-currency ratio.
If you appreciate the script and have profited from it, please consider donating to the following address. 
The JavaScript code is obfuscated to prevent potential misuse.*

#### What does the script do?
*The script automates video playback and utilizes an external captcha solver to resolve captchas. 
The Captcha Solver offers 300 free captchas upon signup. You can input the API key in the file and commence the script.
Manual login after initiating the script is deliberate to prevent misuse on websites.*

#### Does it harm websites?
*The script merely automates the human process of clicking.
You can continue watching videos while the script plays them automatically.
It does not bypass the standard process without viewing videos.*
